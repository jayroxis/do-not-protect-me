# Fix the Windows Defender For Windows 10 and 8 (Easy Guide)

How to safely fix the "virus detected" problem when you download a file (without turn-off the windows defender).

**Works for *Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge*  etc.**

-------------------------------------

For example, you may want to download a file:

<img src="1.png" width="500"/>

However, your browser doesn't like it (actually it is Windows Defender that doesn't like it).

<img src="2.png" width="250"/><img src="3.png" width="250"/>

1. Right click the windows defender's icon located at the bottom bar of your screen. Click "***View Secuirity Dashboard***".

2. Click the "***Virus & threat protection***".
